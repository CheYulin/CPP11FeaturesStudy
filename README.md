# Modern CPP Study
##Description
- This is a repository for recording my journey of modern CPP study, which covers the basic features of CPP11 and
tries to play with Boost, PThread and OpenMp. The whole project is built via Cmake, which is rather convenient.     
- You just need to add some configuration on [CmakeList](./CMakeLists.txt).
